# doomscroll
My goal with this is to provide simple, easily accomplished alternatives to doomscrolling, and a system for tracking what you've done. \
In addition to creating this website for functional use, my aim with this project is to learn to develop with the following new technologies:
- Google Gemini API
- Flask
- SQLite
- Jinja \
And gain more advanced knowledge in:
- Web Design
  - CSS
- AJAX 

## What's next
- Getting and storing user's interests
- Generating, displaying, and storing prompts
  - Allowing responses to prompts maybe? Alternatively just regenerate.
- Recording completed tasks

- Also, will have to make sure to go back and update data functions to remove all related data when a user is deleted.
