# doomscroll
My goal with this is to provide simple, easily accomplished alternatives to doomscrolling, and a system for tracking what you've done. \
In addition to creating this website for functional use, my aim with this project is to learn to develop with the following new technologies:
- Flask
- SQLite
- Gemini API
